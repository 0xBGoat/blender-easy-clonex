## Functionality
**Assembly**  

Easy CloneX adds a new panel to the 3D View in Blender, which you can access by clicking on the small left arrow in the upper-right corner of that view. This panel allows you to load your fully assembled clone into Blender with DNA textures already applied. The panel also provides checkboxes that allow you to easily equip and unequip wearables and traits.

**Armatures/Rigging** 

The add-on automatically updates the armature modifier for all objects to point at the primary armature. All of the duplicated armatures and riggings are deleted to keep things clean.
